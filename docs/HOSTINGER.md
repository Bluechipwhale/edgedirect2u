# Hostinger Business deployment

Hostinger currently documents Node.js Web Apps on Business and Cloud plans, including Next.js and Node 24. Deploy through that facility in hPanel. This app needs a Node server for authentication, payment APIs and server rendering. [Hostinger Node.js setup](https://www.hostinger.com/support/how-to-deploy-a-nodejs-website-in-hostinger/).

## Prepare the release

1. Configure staging Supabase and Paystack using the accompanying guides.
2. Run `npm ci`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run test:e2e`, and `npm run build:hostinger`. Browser tests own an isolated development server. Run `npm run check:production` to verify the packaged server against the configured database.
3. Configure server environment values in Hostinger. Set `LOCAL_DEMO=false`, all Supabase keys, the Paystack secret, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://edgedirect2u.com`. A random `CRON_SECRET` of at least 32 characters is only needed for the optional HTTP scheduler; the connected project's database scheduler is already enabled.
4. Check equivalent local release values with `npm run check:env`. This validates configuration presence, not connectivity.

## Deploy from GitHub

Connect `https://github.com/Bluechipwhale/edgedirect2u` through **Web App → Import Git Repository**, select the `main` branch and repository root, and use the build settings below. Authorize Hostinger's GitHub access if prompted. The `build:hostinger` command generates an ignored `.env.production` from `config/hostinger-public.json`, so GitHub deployments use the same Supabase project and domain as the prepared ZIP without committing environment files. Set `HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0` in Hostinger and leave its assigned `PORT` unchanged.

Store `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY` only in Hostinger environment settings. Future commits pushed to the connected branch can trigger Hostinger rebuilds through its GitHub integration. The included GitHub Actions workflow checks each push and pull request; it does not deploy or apply database migrations. Apply future forward migrations deliberately with `npm run db:plan` and `npm run db:migrate` from a trusted machine, then deploy code that needs them.

## Build settings

Create a Node.js Web App from the source repository or source ZIP. Select Next.js, Node **24**, repository root directory, install command `npm ci --include=dev`, build command `npm run build:hostinger`, and start command `node --use-system-ca .next/standalone/server.js`. Choose `.next` when an output directory is requested. Build dependencies are required to compile TypeScript and CSS; the standalone runtime uses the traced production dependencies.

If the deployment screen requests an entry file instead of a start command, use `.next/standalone/server.js`. The packaging script copies `public` and `.next/static` into that directory. Use the host-assigned `PORT`.

Keep `package-lock.json`. Upload source, public assets and package metadata. Exclude secret `.env` files, `node_modules`, `.data`, `.git`, screenshots and test results. The architecture assumes managed Supabase persistence, with no dependency on Docker, Redis, root access or persistent local application files.

The owner confirmed Hostinger and `edgedirect2u.com`. The prepared `artifacts/hostinger-source.zip` contains source at the archive root and excludes server secrets and generated output. A generated `.env.production` contains the final domain, the supplied Supabase URL/publishable key and `LOCAL_DEMO=false`. Next.js loads it automatically during Hostinger's build and runtime. The same public settings are recorded in `config/hostinger-public.json`; no database password or service-role key is embedded. Hostinger reads the existing Supabase database over HTTPS; no database export or import is needed.

Upload this source ZIP through **Web App → Upload your website files** using the settings above. Hostinger builds Linux output from the source; do not upload a Windows-generated standalone directory. Use the host-assigned `PORT` and `HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0` if binding is requested. Leave obsolete/blank `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` overrides out of hPanel because host environment variables take precedence over the file. Recreate the ZIP on Windows with `powershell -NoProfile -File scripts/package-hostinger.ps1`. Its SHA-256 checksum is written alongside it.

After attaching the domain, open `https://edgedirect2u.com/api/health`. A 200 response with `status: "ok"` confirms the deployed server can read published settings from Supabase. Sign in at `/login` with `olasodechukwudi@gmail.com`, which now has administrator access, then open `/admin`. Products created there persist in the same Supabase database and active products appear on the storefront. The database currently contains no approved catalogue products, so an empty product grid is expected.

Add `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY` privately through Hostinger environment settings, then redeploy. These enable persistent uploads and payment processing; they are not required for public catalogue reads or ordinary authenticated administration. Configure Supabase Auth Site URL as `https://edgedirect2u.com` and permit `https://edgedirect2u.com/auth/confirm` (including recovery query parameters). Use the email templates in `LAUNCH.md`. Once deployed, this app's Paystack webhook is `https://edgedirect2u.com/api/payments/webhook`.

Inspect logs and the temporary preview URL. Verify administrator routes require authentication and local demo access is disabled.

## Domain and HTTPS

Attach `edgedirect2u.com` in the app’s domain settings and follow the DNS values shown by hPanel. Preserve email DNS records. Enable its SSL certificate and HTTPS redirection; redirect `www` to your canonical origin. Rebuild when `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values change. Update Supabase Site URL/redirects and Paystack’s webhook when moving from staging. [Domain connection guide](https://www.hostinger.com/support/how-to-connect-a-custom-domain-to-a-node-js-application/).

## Acceptance and operation

On HTTPS, test registration, sign-in/out, a Storage logo upload, theme draft isolation, publishing and rollback. Use Paystack test mode until financial acceptance passes. Approve merchant applications and verify two merchants cannot read one another’s private records. Add a driver and complete dispatch with recipient confirmation. Verify records and assets survive a redeployment. Configure and test reservation expiry scheduling.

Theme settings are server-loaded per render. Private routes and APIs send no-store headers; host/CDN rules must preserve them. Monitor process limits and image processing resource use.

No Hostinger deployment or domain change was performed during development. Confirm startup settings in the actual account before publishing.
